# Blackjack
This is my first Javascript application project named Blackjack.
Blackjack is a card game, which in this project is completely built using JavaScript.

DIRECTIONS:
1. The participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.
2. It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.
